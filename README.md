# OpenMPF Kubernetes

Welcome to the Open Media Processing Framework (OpenMPF) Kubernetes Project!

## What is the OpenMPF?

OpenMPF provides a platform to perform content detection and extraction on bulk 
multimedia, enabling users to analyze, search, and share information through 
the extraction of objects, keywords, thumbnails, and other contextual data.

OpenMPF enables users to build configurable media processing pipelines, 
enabling the rapid development and deployment of analytic algorithms and 
large-scale media processing applications.

### Search and Share

Simplify large-scale media processing and enable the extraction of meaningful 
content

### Open API

Apply cutting-edge algorithms such as face detection and object classification

### Flexible Architecture

Integrate into your existing environment or use OpenMPF as a standalone 
application

## Overview

This repository contains files that can be used to deploy OpenMPF on a 
Kubernetes cluster.
