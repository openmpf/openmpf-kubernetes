This example shows how to configure Workflow Manager with additional accounts. 
`users.properties` adds the default users and a custom user named `custom-user`.
In this example `custom-user`'s password is `custom-password`. The hash of the 
password used in `users.properties` was generated by running 
`docker run --rm epicsoft/bcrypt hash custom-password 12`. See comments
in `users.properties` for more information.
